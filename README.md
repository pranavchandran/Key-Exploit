Create first page and generate unique token and click on Send button.  

Unique token should have alphanumeric values with counter 001 incremental at the end.  


In first page on click of Send, Encrypt token and redirect to second page.  


Second page should decrypt token and display token with first 4 Alpha and counter value Example ABC001 or XYZ002 ..ITEM013,ITEM014 etc. and also display Back button to send back to first page.
